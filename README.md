This is my first project with react.
Its a furniture ecommerce website.
I know my file names and commit messages makes no sense but that's one of the most frustrating things to do, especially when you have so much stuffs to think about but I know it's importance and will definitely work on it from now on.
This is a really simple website and I think I did a good job as a beginner.
I learnt a lot from this project and I will keep adding new stuffs here
